    <h1>About Coding Club</h1>
    <h2>What do we do?</h2>
    <p>We engage in simple coding and learning more about different languages. From 2023 to 2024, we learned about python. Some projects that we have made are Python word games and many smaller ideas on Python such as arrays, functions, loops, and different things we can do with Python.</p>
